# DBB-BLOCKS
My DBB Blocks Collection. All of this is Selfmade or Modiefyed to Match the Users Wishes ;D

I have fun Makeing some Blocks.

All you have to do is Downloading your Block and put it in the Bot Blocks Folder. Now you can use it without restarting DBB.
Take care about extra dependencis or "need to have" files like FFMPEG if you want to use my Voice stuff, more about this in the Folder ;D

## Wow how then Fuck you make these ?

If you know how Javascript work it won't be a Problem for you too.
Just lock at my [Instructions](https://github.com/Dad-Ju/DBB-Docs/blob/patch-1/faq/blocks.md) :)
